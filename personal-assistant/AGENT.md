# personal-assistant — working agreement

Read [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) first. This file is the set of things that must stay true no matter
which phase you are in or who is editing.

## Invariants

**Capture is append-only, and raw payloads are kept.** Never let a distillation pass be the
only record of what a message said. Every derived row carries `extracted_by` (prompt/model
version) so history can be re-derived when the prompt improves. Deleting a `source_item` is a
retention action, never a cleanup.

**Nothing is sent without a human.** `pa send` is the only path outbound, it is interactive,
and no worker, cron job, skill or agent may call it. If a future phase wants auto-send, that
is a conversation, not a patch.

**A dispatched run never touches the main working tree.** Own worktree under
`../.pa-worktrees/<run-id>`, own branch, removed by `pa drop`. The root `CLAUDE.md` is explicit
that a dirty tree breaks termhub's updater — dispatched work must not be able to cause that.

**Mode boundaries are enforced by the dispatcher, not requested of the agent.** A `local` run
gets no push credential in its environment. Do not implement a stop condition as a sentence in
the prompt and call it done.

**The dispatcher is not tailnet-reachable.** It executes code by design. Loopback and the WSL
interface only. termhub is the thing that is safe to expose, because its trust model is the
tailnet ACL and it was built for that; this is not.

**One implementation per behaviour.** OpenClaw skills call the `pa` CLI. They do not talk to
Postgres, and they do not reimplement dispatch. When the TUI and the CLI disagree about what
`pa do` means, the bug is that there are two implementations.

**Raven stays a skill.** Company engineering conventions are read through the existing
`innergy-knowledge` skill. Do not copy that repo into this store; a second stale copy of the
org's conventions is worse than none.

## Conventions

- **Language:** plain CommonJS JavaScript, matching termhub — which is not TypeScript, and is
  the better for it: no build step means `git pull` is the whole deployment. Tests are
  `assert`-based files run directly by `node`, as termhub's are.
- **Migrations:** plain numbered SQL, applied by a script. No ORM migrations framework.
- **No job queue.** "Work to do" is a query — items with no distillation row at the current
  prompt version. A queue table can get stuck, leak, or need draining after a crash; a query
  cannot. The worker is a scheduler of periodic passes, and passes never overlap themselves.
- **Secrets:** never in the repo, never in Postgres in plaintext. Graph refresh tokens go in a
  DPAPI-protected file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\personal-assistant\`; GitLab and API keys come
  from the environment.
- **Times:** store UTC, render local. Every `due_at` the distiller writes is absolute — a row
  that says "Friday" is a bug.
- **Logs:** message bodies are not log material. Log ids, counts, and durations.

## The store lives in WSL, and WSL will drop it

Docker Desktop on the target machine runs the **Windows** container engine, and there is no
Windows image for Postgres, let alone one with pgvector. So the store is Postgres 16 +
pgvector installed inside the existing WSL Ubuntu distro, on port 5433, reached from Windows
over WSL's localhost forwarding. `docker-compose.yml` stays in the tree as the right answer on
a machine whose Docker runs Linux containers.

The non-obvious part: **WSL terminates a distro once the last `wsl.exe` client exits**, taking
Postgres with it, even though systemd is running it as a service. The symptom is
`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5433` at unpredictable intervals, minutes after everything worked. The
fix is the `pa-wsl-keepalive` logon task that `windows/install.ps1` registers — one
`sleep infinity` holding the distro open. If connections start failing at random, check that
task before suspecting anything in this codebase.

## Reading termhub before writing dispatch

The session substrate is termhub's, and it has already solved most of what dispatch needs:
`POST /api/sessions {cwd, command, title}` to start a Claude session in a directory,
`GET /api/sessions` for state, per-session idle tracking with ntfy escalation, and spoken
announcements driven by reading Claude Code's own transcript. Read `termhub/AGENT.md` before
building anything in that space — in particular the two-tier `front`/`sessiond` split, which
is why sessions survive updates and why the API you want is on `sessiond`.

Typing into a session currently goes over the `/ws/term/*` websocket. Adding
`POST /api/sessions/:id/input` is a unit of work **in termhub**, not a websocket client hidden
in here.

## Definition of done for a unit of work

The root `CLAUDE.md` governs: committed to `main` and pushed, docs corrected in the same
commit, tests green. On top of that, for this tool specifically — if a change alters the schema,
the migration ships in the same commit as the code that reads it, and `pa doctor` is taught to
check whatever new thing can now be misconfigured.

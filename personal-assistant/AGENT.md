# personal-assistant — working agreement

Read [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) first. This file is the set of things that must stay true no matter
which phase you are in or who is editing.

## Invariants

**Capture is append-only, and raw payloads are kept.** Never let a distillation pass be the
only record of what a message said. Every derived row carries `extracted_by` (prompt/model
version) so history can be re-derived when the prompt improves. Deleting a `source_item` is a
retention action, never a cleanup.

**Nothing is sent without a human.** `pa send` is the only path outbound, it is interactive,
and no worker, cron job, skill or agent may call it. If a future phase wants auto-send, that
is a conversation, not a patch.

**A dispatched run never touches the main working tree.** Own worktree under
`../.pa-worktrees/<run-id>`, own branch, removed by `pa drop`. The root `CLAUDE.md` is explicit
that a dirty tree breaks termhub's updater — dispatched work must not be able to cause that.

**Mode boundaries are enforced by the dispatcher, not requested of the agent.** A `local` run
gets no push credential in its environment. Do not implement a stop condition as a sentence in
the prompt and call it done.

**The dispatcher is not tailnet-reachable.** It executes code by design. Loopback and the WSL
interface only. termhub is the thing that is safe to expose, because its trust model is the
tailnet ACL and it was built for that; this is not.

**One implementation per behaviour.** OpenClaw skills call the `pa` CLI. They do not talk to
Postgres, and they do not reimplement dispatch. When the TUI and the CLI disagree about what
`pa do` means, the bug is that there are two implementations.

**Raven stays a skill.** Company engineering conventions are read through the existing
`innergy-knowledge` skill. Do not copy that repo into this store; a second stale copy of the
org's conventions is worse than none.

## Conventions

- **Language:** TypeScript, matching termhub. Node's own test runner, as termhub uses.
- **Migrations:** plain numbered SQL, applied by a script. No ORM migrations framework.
- **Secrets:** never in the repo, never in Postgres in plaintext. Graph refresh tokens go in a
  DPAPI-protected file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\personal-assistant\`; GitLab and API keys come
  from the environment.
- **Times:** store UTC, render local. Every `due_at` the distiller writes is absolute — a row
  that says "Friday" is a bug.
- **Logs:** message bodies are not log material. Log ids, counts, and durations.

## Reading termhub before writing dispatch

The session substrate is termhub's, and it has already solved most of what dispatch needs:
`POST /api/sessions {cwd, command, title}` to start a Claude session in a directory,
`GET /api/sessions` for state, per-session idle tracking with ntfy escalation, and spoken
announcements driven by reading Claude Code's own transcript. Read `termhub/AGENT.md` before
building anything in that space — in particular the two-tier `front`/`sessiond` split, which
is why sessions survive updates and why the API you want is on `sessiond`.

Typing into a session currently goes over the `/ws/term/*` websocket. Adding
`POST /api/sessions/:id/input` is a unit of work **in termhub**, not a websocket client hidden
in here.

## Definition of done for a unit of work

The root `CLAUDE.md` governs: committed to `main` and pushed, docs corrected in the same
commit, tests green. On top of that, for this tool specifically — if a change alters the schema,
the migration ships in the same commit as the code that reads it, and `pa doctor` is taught to
check whatever new thing can now be misconfigured.
